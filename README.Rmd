This repository holds the analysis for Graham et al. (in press). 

* The simulations from the manuscript can be replicated by following `AppendixI.pdf`
* The *Garrulus glandarius* case study from the manuscript can be replicated by following `AppendixII.pdf` - note that Land Cover Map 2007 (25m resolution) data will be required for this case study. These data are available from [Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/land-cover-map-2007) (licence required) or can be downloaded (with institutional licence) from [Edina digimap](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/).
