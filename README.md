This repository holds the analysis for [Graham et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13177).

  - The simulations from the manuscript can be replicated by following
    `AppendixI.pdf`
  - The *Garrulus glandarius* case study from the manuscript can be
    replicated by following `AppendixII.pdf` - note that Land Cover Map
    2007 (25m resolution) data will be required for this case study.
    These data are available from [Centre for Ecology and
    Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/land-cover-map-2007)
    (licence required) or can be downloaded (with institutional licence)
    from [Edina digimap](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/).
