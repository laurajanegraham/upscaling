# Upscaling: Simulations

## Simulation One: continuous variables

This simulation will show the use of the moving window-based spatial structure measure for continuous variables which have finer scale variation than the resolution of analysis. This could be, for example, topographic or microclimate variation. 

### Simulated landscapes
### Use winmover function
### Results (see Macro 2017 poster)

## Simulation Two: categorical variables

This simulation will show the use of the moving window-based spatial structure measure for categorical variables which have finer scale variation than the resolution of analysis. This is appropriate for more classical landscape ecology questions about habitat structure. 

### Simulated landscapes
### Use winmover function
### Results (see Macro 2017 poster)
